err-plugins
===========

This plugin can be used to control a remote camera (for example, at home) using XMPP. The original idea was to be able to control some home computer without needing to open ports at the DSL router and so on.

The main ideas can be found at [My second bot](https://makingfernand0.wordpress.com/2014/06/15/my-second-bot/) and more ideas about a more complete project at [ A mobile camera ](https://makingfernand0.wordpress.com/2014/07/20/a-mobile-camera/).

The bot is able to send orders to some servomotor than can make the camera move in order to point to different parts.
